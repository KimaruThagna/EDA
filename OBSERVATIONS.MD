WINE ATTRIBUTES CORRELATION HEATMAP
Alcohol content and density are strongly negatively correlated(-0.69)
Free sulphur dioxide and total suplhur dioxide are strongly positively correlated(0.72)
In the pairwise scatter plots with linear regression fitted, the line has a positive slope
hence showing most pairs are +vely correlated.
In the Parallel coordinate Figure,
Red wine seems to have a lower total sulphur dioxide and higher acidity content
compared to white wine which also has a lower density
